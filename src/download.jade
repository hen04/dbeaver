			p Tested and verified for MS Windows XP/7/8/10, Linux and Mac OS X.DBeaver itself requires Java 1.7 or higher. Windows installers includes JRE 1.8. If you are NOT on Windows you have to setup Java. 
			p If you are on Mac OS X then you will need JDK 1.7+. Note: 3rd-party JDBC drivers may have have their own system requirements.

			h2 Install
			p ZIP archive – extract archive and run “dbeaver” executable. Do not extract archive over previous version (remove previous version before install). Java 1.7+ must be installed separately. 
			p Windows installer – run installer executable. It will automatically upgrade version (if needed). Installer doesn’t change any system settings or Java installation. Included JRE will be accessible only for DBeaver.
			p Debian package – run sudo dpkg -i dbeaver-<version>.deb. Then execute “dbeaver &”. RPM package – run sudo rpm -ivh dbeaver-<version>.rpm. Then execute “dbeaver &”. Note: to upgrade use “-Uvh” parameter. Mac OS X – recent Mac OS versions may reject to install unsigned software. Check this topic for possible workarounds.

			h2 Notes
			p DBeaver is free software. You can use it for any purpose with no limitations. This software is provided “as is” without express or implied warranty. 
			p Windows Installer will automatically install DBeaver on your computer. Java Runtime will be installed as a part of DBeaver installation. If you already have JRE installed on your computer you may disable JRE option in installer. However it is recommended to use JRE shipped with DBeaver (it won’t be break any existing JRE installation, nothing will be copied in system folders, registry or environment variables). 
			p Debian installer will setup all required components (including JRE) prior to DBeaver installation. 
			p All other versions are just minimal archives that don’t contain the JRE or an installer. Just unzip and start dbeaver executable (if you upgrade from a previous DBeaver version then delete it before upgrade).
